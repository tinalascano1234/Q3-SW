				 		<h2>My review on The Notebook !</h2> 
				 		 <p>One of my comfort movies! It shows how love can be confusing and how many sacrifices should be made. It shows all the challenges couples have to face, and it showed how they found each other again because they were meant for each other. The story is well written and has the best ending it could possibly have, for me the movie is a 4.5/5!</p>

				 	<h2>My review on Five Feet Apart!</h2>
				 	<p>The movie Five Feet Apart was one of the first movies to make me cry FOR WEEKS! Everytime I thought of the movie my eyes would well up. The fact that two people could fall in love so fast, but at the same time, are forbidden to be with each other becase of a life and death situation was heartbreaking. Definitely a 5/5!</p>
